## [3.3] — 2026-04-20 — Security Hardening

Full security audit against 35 principles from OWASP LLM Top 10 v2, Willison's lethal trifecta, Greshake et al. (arXiv:2302.12173), Invariant Labs MCP research, and community incident reports. Result: 7 new defenses, 0 capability regressions.

### Added

**Guardian new categories:**
- `SUPPLY_CHAIN` — blocks `pip install` from HTTP URLs and non-PyPI indexes
- `SECRET_EXFIL` — detects hardcoded AWS/OpenAI/GitHub/Anthropic/Slack keys in network commands; only keychain subshell expansion is legitimate
- `LOOP` — halts session if the same Bash command repeats 3× (stuck-agent guard), keyed to the stable Claude process PID

**Memory integrity:**
- SHA256 `content_hash` stored on every `save_procedure` call
- Hash verified on every `find_procedure` / `get_skill` call
- Tampered procedures auto-quarantined and deprecated (prevents cross-session memory poisoning)
- Idempotent `_migrate()` adds columns to existing databases

**Session hardening:**
- `bin/content-sanitizer.sh` — wraps all external web/tool output in `[UNTRUSTED_CONTENT]` delimiters; scans for 22 injection patterns, strips zero-width chars, detects large base64 blocks
- `bin/budget.sh` — per-session spend cap: 5 signups / $20 / 500 tool calls; `preflight.sh` calls `budget.sh init` at every session start
- `.claude/settings.json` — Claude Code sandbox config: `denyRead` on credential dirs (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, etc.), network allowlist at kernel level

**MCP rug-pull detection:**
- `config/mcp-tool-manifest.json` — trusted `mcp__` tool name prefixes
- Guardian warns on any MCP tool call whose prefix isn't in the manifest
- `bin/mcp-manifest-check.sh` — standalone hook for non-autopilot sessions

**Ephemeral browser profiles:**
- `chrome-debug.sh ephemeral-start [task-id]` — fresh Chrome profile in `/tmp`, port 9223
- `chrome-debug.sh ephemeral-stop` — kills browser and wipes profile (no trace)
- Used for: signups, OAuth flows, cross-service tasks

**Agent identity & drift:**
- `preflight.sh` writes `~/.autopilot/gitconfig` (`user.name = autopilot-bot`) on first run; agent commits with `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=~/.autopilot/gitconfig`
- Goal drift checkpoint: re-read original task every 10 Bash calls, course-correct if drifted
- ToS review step 5.5 in self-expansion: scan ToS before registering any new service
- `tos_automated` field added to service registry template

## [3.2] — 2026-04-15 — AppleScript GUI Automation (macOS)

### Added
- `bin/osascript.sh` — safe AppleScript runner with path traversal protection, 30s timeout, structured exit codes
- `applescripts/frontmost-info.applescript` — active app JSON (name, bundle ID, window title, PID)
- `applescripts/app-control.applescript` — open / focus / quit / status / relaunch apps
- `applescripts/clipboard.applescript` — read / write / clear clipboard
- `applescripts/handle-system-dialog.applescript` — click named buttons on sheets and dialogs
- Guardian Category 10 (APPLESCRIPT): blocks inline `osascript -e`, JXA, non-whitelisted paths
- `protocols/gui-automation.md` — when to use AppleScript vs Playwright vs Computer Use
- Service interaction priority updated: AppleScript sits between Playwright and Computer Use

## [3.1] — 2026-04-10 — Compiler, Parallel Agents, Sandbox, Compression

### Added
- `bin/guardian-compile.sh` — YAML → compiled rules cache with validation
- `bin/lockfile.sh` — file-based lock coordinator for parallel agent execution
- `bin/mcp-compress.sh` — wraps MCP servers for ~97% schema token savings
- `protocols/sandboxing.md` — macOS sandbox-exec profiles for L3+ operations
- `protocols/parallel-execution.md` — splitting multi-service plans into parallel groups

---

## [3.0] — 2026-04-05 — Fully Autonomous

### Changed
- Decision framework collapsed from 5 levels to 3 (L1/L2/L3)
- L1: everything that was L1-L3 before — just do it
- L2: flag cost but keep going
- L3: escalate (2FA, CAPTCHA only)
- No more "ask first" level — agent acts on all non-destructive operations

### Added
- `bin/repo-context.sh` — cached project summary for fast codebase onboarding
- `protocols/model-routing.md` — delegate to Haiku/Sonnet when Opus not needed
- `protocols/review-gate.md` — cross-model review gate for L3+ operations

---

## [2.0] — 2026-03-25 — Sprint 1: Memory, TOTP, Email

### Added
- `lib/memory.py` — unified SQLite memory store (traces, procedures, errors, services, costs, health)
- `lib/playbook.py` — browser automation playbook store
- `bin/totp.sh` — TOTP code generator (2FA automation)
- `bin/verify-email.sh` — email verification link extractor
- `bin/token-report.sh` — token savings dashboard
- `bin/harvest.sh` — credential harvester from service dashboards
- `bin/audit.sh` — execution log terminal dashboard
- `bin/snapshot.sh` — snapshot & rollback (git stash wrapper)
- `bin/session.sh` — session persistence (save/resume across rate limits)
- Voyager-style skill composition — procedures become reusable skills after 3+ successes

- `protocols/` — adaptive resolution, credential management, browser automation, self-expansion
- `/autopilot` slash command integration
