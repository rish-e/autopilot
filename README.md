> AI coding agents today are either autonomous but unsafe (Devin, Cursor — sandbox-only safety) or safe but constantly asking for permission (vanilla Claude Code). Autopilot is the third option: fully autonomous, with a deterministic safety layer the AI cannot override, and it teaches itself new services as it encounters them.

```
claude --agent autopilot
> Set up Supabase for this project with user auth, deploy to Vercel, and configure Razorpay payments.

Autopilot: Here's the plan:
  1. Install Supabase CLI
  2. Sign up & create project
  3. Run migrations (users, api_keys, usage_logs)
  4. Install Vercel CLI & deploy to preview
  5. Set environment variables from Supabase
  6. Get Razorpay API keys (needs 2FA)
  7. Configure webhook

Proceed? yes

[1/7] Supabase CLI installed via brew
[2/7] Signed up at supabase.com .................. ACCOUNT CREATED
[3/7] Migrations complete — 3 tables created
[4/7] Deploying to preview ....................... https://myapp-abc123.vercel.app
[5/7] Environment variables set from Supabase
[6/7] Opening Razorpay dashboard... "Enter the OTP sent to your phone."
> [user enters OTP]
[7/7] Razorpay keys stored, webhook configured

Done. Preview: https://myapp-abc123.vercel.app
All actions logged to .autopilot/log.md
```

## What Can It Do?

Autopilot is a **general-purpose autonomous agent** — not limited to any specific service or workflow:

| Category | Examples |
|:---------|:---------|
| **Deploy code** | Vercel, Netlify, Railway, Cloudflare Workers, Fly.io |
| **Set up databases** | Supabase, PostgreSQL, Firebase, Redis |
| **Manage infrastructure** | R2 buckets, KV stores, DNS, SSL, CDN |
| **Configure services** | Stripe, Razorpay, SendGrid, Resend, Sentry, Auth0, Clerk |
| **Handle git** | Commits, branches, PRs, issues, Actions, releases |
| **Browse the web** | Login to dashboards, fill forms, get API tokens |
| **Install tools** | CLIs, MCP servers, dependencies |
| **Teach itself** | Unknown service? Researches docs, creates registry, installs CLI, keeps going |

The 5 pre-built service files are just a head start. Autopilot self-expands when it encounters anything new.

  |   Windows: Cred Manager  |  |   55 tested patterns     |
  +--------------------------+  +--------------------------+
```

**Priority:** MCP > CLI > API > Browser > Ask user

## Features

### Fully Autonomous
> Autopilot acts first, asks only when the decision framework says to. It deploys code, configures databases, manages infrastructure, and obtains credentials — all without you leaving the terminal.

### Plan > Confirm > Execute All
> For complex tasks: numbered plan, single "proceed", then runs every step without pausing. Simple tasks execute immediately. **Never stops to ask "what next?"**

### Project-Local Execution Log
> Every action logged to `{project}/.autopilot/log.md` — timestamped, with decision level and result. Account creations, logins, and token acquisitions are tracked with special markers.

### Zero-Touch Credentials
> Set your primary email and password once. Autopilot uses them for all new service signups. Stored in your OS credential store (Keychain / libsecret / Credential Manager).

### Self-Expanding
> Unknown service? Researches docs, creates registry file, installs CLI, adds safety rules, keeps going — all inline, no stopping.

### Hard Safety Rails

```
  Command Entered
       |
       v
  [Guardian Hook]              exit code 2 = HARD BLOCK
       |                        (overrides all permissions)
       |-- rm -rf / ?           BLOCKED
       |-- bash -c "evil" ?     BLOCKED
       |-- npm publish ?        BLOCKED
       |-- git push --force ?   BLOCKED
       |-- vercel --prod ?      BLOCKED
       |-- DROP DATABASE ?      BLOCKED
       |-- base64 | bash ?      BLOCKED
       |-- npm install ?        ALLOWED
       v
  [Permission Allowlist]       auto-approve safe commands
       |
       v
  Command Executes (no prompt)
```

### Persistent Browser

```
  Chrome (background)  <-- CDP -->  Playwright MCP  <-->  Claude Code
        |                                 |
    Always alive                    Dies with session
    Sessions persist                Reconnects on start
```

Three layers: (1) persistent Chrome via CDP, (2) auto-retry on tab crashes, (3) smart browser avoidance.

### Decision Framework

| Level | Action | Examples |
|:------|:-------|:---------|
| 1 — Just do it | Brief note | `npm install`, `git push`, read files |
| 2 — Do it, notify | Brief note | Preview deploys, create branches |
| 3 — Ask first | Wait for approval | Prod deploys, destructive DB ops |
| 4 — Must ask | Show exact command | Spending money, publishing |
| 5 — Escalate | Cannot proceed | 2FA codes, CAPTCHAs |

## Usage

### `/autopilot` — Slash Command (recommended)

Use from any Claude Code session — no separate terminal needed:

```bash
/autopilot deploy this to Vercel with environment variables from Supabase
/autopilot set up Supabase with user auth tables and API keys
/autopilot configure Stripe payments with webhooks
/autopilot create a Cloudflare R2 bucket for image storage
```

### Agent Mode — Full Sessions

For big multi-service orchestrations:

```bash
claude --agent autopilot --dangerously-skip-permissions

> I need this running in production with a Postgres database, Stripe payments, and Sentry monitoring
```

### When to use which

| Situation | Use |
|:----------|:----|
| Quick deploy, get an API key | `/autopilot` |
| Full project setup from scratch | Agent mode |
| Mid-coding infrastructure task | `/autopilot` |
| Multi-service orchestration (5+ services) | Agent mode |

## Execution Log

Every action is tracked in your project:

```
your-project/.autopilot/log.md
```

```markdown
## Session: 2026-03-25 14:05 — Set up Supabase and deploy to Vercel

| # | Time  | Action                                     | Level | Service  | Result              |
|---|-------|--------------------------------------------|-------|----------|---------------------|

```

## Audit Dashboard

View the execution log from the terminal with `audit.sh`:

```bash
audit.sh                     # Latest session
audit.sh all                 # All sessions
audit.sh search supabase     # Search logs
audit.sh accounts            # Account activity (signups, logins, tokens)
audit.sh failures            # Failed actions only
audit.sh summary             # One-line-per-session overview
audit.sh --path ~/myproject  # Specify project path
```

Color-coded output: green = done, red = FAILED, yellow = ACCOUNT CREATED, blue = LOGGED IN, cyan = TOKEN STORED.

---

## Snapshot & Rollback

Before executing a plan, Autopilot snapshots the current state using `git stash`. If something goes wrong, roll back instantly.

```bash
snapshot.sh create pre-deploy   # Create a named snapshot
snapshot.sh list                # List all autopilot snapshots
snapshot.sh rollback            # Rollback to latest snapshot
snapshot.sh rollback pre-deploy # Rollback to a specific snapshot
snapshot.sh diff                # Show what changed since snapshot
snapshot.sh clean               # Remove all autopilot snapshots
```

Snapshots are automatic during complex tasks (Flow B). The agent creates one before executing any plan and mentions rollback availability in the completion report. Metadata is stored in `.autopilot/snapshots.json`.

---

## Session Persistence

Work survives rate limits and crashes. Autopilot saves progress after each step so it can resume where it left off.

```bash
session.sh save "Deploy to Vercel"  # Save session state
session.sh status                    # Check if a saved session exists
session.sh resume                    # Show full saved session for pickup
session.sh update '{"current_step": 3, "notes": "Step 2 done"}'  # Update progress
session.sh clear                     # Remove saved session
```

On startup (Flow B), the agent checks for a saved session and offers to resume. Session data is stored in `.autopilot/session.json` and includes the task, plan, completed steps, services used, and notes.

## Safety Model

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### What Gets Blocked (55 patterns)

| Category | Examples |
|:---------|:---------|
| System destruction | `rm -rf /`, `sudo rm -rf`, `mkfs` |
| Credential leak | `echo $(keychain get)`, pipe to curl |
| Database destruction | `DROP DATABASE`, `TRUNCATE` |
| Git/publishing | `git push --force`, `npm publish` |
| Production deploys | `vercel --prod`, `terraform destroy` |
| Account changes | `gh repo --visibility public` |
| Financial | Stripe charges, sending emails |
| MCP process termination | Targeting Playwright/MCP servers |
| Obfuscation | `base64\|bash`, `bash -c`, `eval` |

</td>
<td width="50%">

### The Safety Contract

| Layer | Can AI bypass? |
|:------|:--------------|
| Guardian hook (shell script) | **No** — deterministic |
| Permission allowlist | **No** — evaluated by Claude Code |
| Decision framework | In theory — Guardian catches it |
| Credential store | **No** — OS-level encryption |

### Autopilot-Scoped

Guardian is installed as a global hook but **only activates during autopilot sessions** — regular Claude Code sessions skip it entirely with zero overhead. Detection uses two methods:
- **Process tree**: detects `claude --agent autopilot` in ancestor processes
- **Session marker**: `preflight.sh` creates `/tmp/.guardian-active-<PID>` for `/autopilot` slash command sessions (auto-cleaned on exit)

### Self-Tightening

The system only gets **more restrictive**:
- Custom rules are **append-only**
- Guardian script is **immutable**
- MCP whitelist is **additive only**

No interruption. Only pauses for 2FA codes and first-time primary credentials.

## How It Compares

| Capability | Autopilot | Devin | Cursor Agents | Claude Code (vanilla) |
|:-----------|:----------|:------|:--------------|:---------------------|
| Autonomous deployment | Yes (CLI + browser) | Yes (sandbox) | Yes (VM) | Needs permission |
| Browser credential acquisition | Yes (Playwright CDP) | Partial | Partial | No |
| Hard safety rails | Yes (Guardian) | Sandbox only | Sandbox only | Permission prompts |
| Self-expanding knowledge | Yes | No | No | No |
| MCP auto-discovery | Yes (whitelist) | No | Partial | No |
| Credential vault | Yes (OS-native) | Session-scoped | VM-scoped | No |
| Append-only safety | Yes | No | No | No |
| Cross-platform | macOS, Linux, Windows | Cloud only | Cloud only | Yes |
| Open source | Yes (MIT) | No | No | CLI only |

---

## Limitations

**Hard blockers** (cannot automate):
- 2FA/MFA codes — sent to your phone
- CAPTCHAs — can't solve image challenges
- Email verification — requires inbox access
- PCI-compliant payment forms — resist automation

**Technical:**
- Chrome CDP needs to be running (`chrome-debug.sh start` — installer does this automatically)
- Browser UIs change — Playwright steps can break when dashboards redesign
- New MCPs need a session restart to take effect

---

## Contributing

| Contribution | Impact |
